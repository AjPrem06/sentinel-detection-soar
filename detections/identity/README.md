# Identity Detections

This folder contains Microsoft Sentinel detections focused on
identity-related activity in Entra ID / Azure AD.

The detections in this section are designed to identify:
- Suspicious sign-in behavior
- Brute force and password spray attempts
- Impossible travel scenarios
- MFA anomalies
- Privileged account misuse
- Token and session abuse indicators

Each detection will be:
- Written in KQL
- Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Documented with tuning guidance
- Designed to minimize false positives

As this repository evolves, detections may be refined and optimized
based on real-world SOC use cases.
